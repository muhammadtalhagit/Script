# Polished Buyer Script for Facebook Marketplace (UK)

---

Hi! Is the car still available?

How long have you had this car?

Mind if I ask a few quick questions about it?

* Does the vehicle need any maintenance or are any services due?
* Is the car in your name?
* Any history of accidents, theft, or major repairs that you know of?

I’m really interested, and I just want to be sure about everything before arranging a viewing.
Could you please share a complete inspection report?

My dad / husband / mechanic asked me to get this done before we travel to view the car.
Here’s the site my family/mechanic recommends for the check:
[https://www.provehiclecheck.co.uk/](https://www.provehiclecheck.co.uk/)

---

**If they ask why you aren’t buying it yourself:**
Well, it’s your car right now, not mine — I just want to be confident before we travel and waste anyone’s time.
If the report comes out clean, I’ll go ahead with the deal at your asking price.
I’ll also pay you back for the cost of the report.

---

**If they hesitate:**
I understand mate, but I’ve had bad experiences recently where I paid for reports, and the sellers just disappeared.
That’s why I prefer the seller to get it this time — saves both of us time and hassle.

---

**If they ask if they have to pay:**
I appreciate you taking the time. Don’t worry about the cost — if the report comes out clean, I’ll repay you for the report as part of the deal.

---

**If they ask about other reports:**
I understand — I’ve tried DoneDeal, CarVertical, and a few others before, but I had a bad experience where data was incomplete.
That’s why I prefer this site.

---

**If they want to wait to do the report:**
It usually takes about an hour to get the report, so if you could do it today, we can finalize everything quickly.
I’m keen to wrap this up soon as I need the car urgently.

---

**If they ask about meeting:**
Once we have the report sorted, I’m happy to come down at a time that suits you.
Could we aim for tomorrow afternoon?

## 🚗 **Final Polished Buyer Script (UK - Facebook Marketplace)**

**Hi! Is the car still available?**

**How long have you owned the car?**

**Do you mind if I ask a few quick questions?**

* Is the vehicle registered in your name?
* Does it need any maintenance or is any service due?
* Has it ever been in an accident, stolen, or had any major repairs?

---

💬 **I’m very interested in the car, but before I arrange a viewing, my dad / mechanic / husband asked me to make sure I review a proper inspection report. Could you please share one?**

👉 **Here’s the site my family/mechanic recommended:**
[https://www.provehiclecheck.co.uk/](https://www.provehiclecheck.co.uk/)

### If seller asks: “Why don’t you get the report yourself?”

➡ *Well mate, it’s your car at the moment, not mine. I just want to be sure before we both spend time arranging a viewing. If the report comes out clean, I’ll go ahead at your asking price and I’ll also repay you for the cost of the report.*

---

### If seller hesitates:

➡ *I totally understand. It’s just I’ve already paid for a couple of reports recently where the sellers disappeared afterwards. So I’d prefer the seller to get it this time. Saves both of us time and trouble.*

---

### If seller asks: “Do I have to pay for it?”

➡ *Yes, but don’t worry — if the report is clean and we finalize the deal, I’ll repay you for the cost of the report along with the car price.*

---

### If seller says: “I have a DoneDeal / CarVertical / other report”

➡ *I appreciate that, but in the past I had incomplete info from those checks, that’s why I prefer this site.*

---

### If seller says: “I will do it later / when we meet”

➡ *The report usually takes about an hour. If you could do it today, it’ll save time at the meetup and we can finalize the deal smoothly. I really need the car urgently.*

---

### If seller asks: “When do you want to meet?”

➡ *Once we have the report sorted, I can come at a time that suits you. Tomorrow afternoon works for me — does that work for you?*

---

## ⚡ **Optional closing line:**

➡ *If you don’t feel comfortable getting the report, no worries — just let me know so I can look at other cars. I’m happy to pay your asking price if the report is clean.*
