## ✅ **High-Converting Chat Script (for CW Vehicle Report)**

> 📍This is written for a **US-based seller** — but can easily be modified for UK with IVR mention.

---

**You:**
Hey! Is it still available?

---

**Seller:**
Yes, it is.

---

**You:**
Nice. So when would be a good time for me to come view it?

---

**Seller:**
I’m available today or tomorrow.

---

**You:**
Alright, sounds good. Could you please share the location?

---

**Seller:**
Sure, it's \[location].

---

**You:**
Thanks. Before I come, just a couple of quick things I usually ask:

* Is there any **oil leakage** or **rusting** in the body?
* Is the **car title in your name** or someone else's?

---

**Seller:**
\[Answers accordingly]

---

**You:**
Perfect, appreciate that.
Just one last thing — could you also share the **CW vehicle history report**?

I always ask for it before meeting, just to make sure everything’s clean on paper.
Mileage, accidents, engine issues, title check — it saves both of us time if everything’s verified before I travel.

---

### ❌ Seller: “Why don’t you get it?”

**You:**
Totally understand your point, but I always ask the seller to provide it.
When a seller shares the report, it shows confidence in the car and builds trust — especially for serious buyers like me.

If everything looks good in the report, I’ll likely come straight away and close the deal.

---

### ❌ Seller: “The car is clean, no need for a report.”

**You:**
I believe you, and that’s exactly why the report will help.
It confirms everything you said and helps me move ahead with full confidence — no doubts, no delay.

---

### ❌ Seller: “I’ll give it later.”

**You:**
I understand. It’s just my habit to verify these things first — I’m also looking at a couple of other cars, but yours is on top.
If the report is clean, I won’t waste your time — I’ll come and possibly lock the deal in one go.

---

### ✅ Final Push (Buy the Report Now)

**You:**
So if you could please generate the **CW report from Wheels Verified** — it takes less than 2 minutes.
Just send it here, and if everything looks good, we’ll move ahead right away.

---

### Optional: (If they hesitate again)

**You:**
Honestly, if you want, I can even split the report cost with you.
I’m serious about buying — I just need confirmation before I step out.

---

### 🔚 Close Smoothly

**You:**
Thanks again! Looking forward to the report so we can proceed.
